Looking up the contents of the meta file and the related prompt to understand what "execute" entails before running any commands.

Reading the target prompt file to perform the review and correct language/technical terms as specified by the meta task.

I'll correct the language and technical wording in `mwt-g/prompts/v00.00.01.md` per the meta task, improving clarity and accuracy while preserving intent.

# v00.00.01 - mwt-g

## Overview

mwt-g is a command-line tool for creating and launching URL aliases. It can be used within a project or installed globally.

## Features

- Custom URL scheme: `g:/<alias>` → `https://www.google.com/` (example)
- Settings are stored in:
  - A JSON file
  - Searched in the following order (first match wins):
    - Project-local: `./mwt-g/settings.json`
    - User-level: `~/.config/mwt-g/settings.json`

## Usage
- Adding an alias
  ```
  g y yahoo
  ```
  - `y` is the alias name
  - If the second parameter is a bare keyword (no scheme), it resolves to `https://www.<param2>.com`

- Visiting the alias
  ```
  g y
  ```
  - Opens the user's default browser to `https://www.yahoo.com/`

- Deep links
  ```
  g yn yahoo/news
  ```
  - `yn` is the alias name
  - Expands to `https://www.<param2>.com/news` → `https://www.yahoo.com/news`

- List aliases
  ```
  g +list
  ```
  - Lists all known aliases

- Register URL scheme
  ```
  g +register
  ```
  - Registers the custom `g:/` URL scheme with the OS so links like `g:/y` open via this tool

```

I reviewed `mwt-g/prompts/v00.00.01.md` per the meta task and edited for clarity and technical accuracy. Next, I'll check for any linter issues in the edited file.

- Edited `mwt-g/prompts/v00.00.01.md` to improve grammar, clarity, and technical precision:
  - Clarified overview to describe it as a CLI for URL aliases.
  - Made the custom URL scheme explicit with backticks and example.
  - Clarified settings lookup order and paths.
  - Refined usage examples, added explicit behavior for bare keywords, and improved deep link explanation.
  - Renamed list/register actions for clarity.

- Verified no linter errors in `mwt-g/prompts/v00.00.01.md`.

Scanning the updated meta file and the prompt to understand the exact execution tasks, then I’ll implement the required changes and create any needed files, tests, and scripts.

Reviewing the latest contents of the prompt to correct language, align feature references, and fix numbering per the meta instructions.

Making language and reference fixes per the meta instructions, then I’ll validate there are no linter issues.

-----------------------------------------------------------
## AI INSTRUCTIONS

1. Only execute items marked with `[R]`.
  - `[ ]` indicates backlog (not yet ready to implement).
  - `[R]` indicates ready to implement in the current session.
  - `[I]` indicates the AI has implemented the code; set this once the work is completed in this session.
  - `[x]` indicates the user has signed off on the implementation.

The prompt to execute the sequence will be
```
Review prompt v00.00.01.md and execute all features marked with [R]
```

- Feature-03: Adding an alias smartly
  ```
  g y yahoo
  ```
  - `y` is the alias name
  - If the second parameter is a bare keyword (no scheme), it resolves to `https://www.<param2>.com`

- Feature-04: Deep links
  ```
  g yn yahoo/news

  ```
  g +register
  ```
  - Registers the custom `g:/` URL scheme with the OS so links like `g:/y` open via this tool

-----------------------------------------------------------
## Technical requirements

### Build Tool instructions
1. Build the tool using PowerShell 7, which should be available everywhere — Windows, macOS, and Linux.
1. Create the tool using best practices for portability — use Context7 to ensure that the most current documentation and best practices are adhered to.
1. Create the script as `mwt-g.ps1` in the `bin/` directory for this project.

### Test Tool instructions
1. Create a test script under `tests/`.
1. Create tests for the `+n` option.
1. Create tests for the `+c` option.


-----------------------------------------------------------
## APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION

### ALWAYS ###
- Maintain a `README.md` for the tool.
- Always write a test and always run the test after each session sequence.

### v00.01.01 
Create the initial version of the application as follows:

1. [R] Implement the ability to add a basic URL (`g g https://www.google.com`). [Feature-01]
1. [R] Implement `+n` (display URL) and make it the default. [Feature-06]

### v00.01.02
1. [ ] Implement `+c` (fetch via curl). [Feature-06]

### v00.01.03
1. [ ] Implement `+b` (open in browser). [Feature-06]

### v00.01.04
1. [ ] Implement smart URL handling. [Feature-03]
1. [ ] Implement deep links. [Feature-04]

### Future


-----------------------------------------------------------
# IGNORE BELOW #



- Implement command line completions.
- Add long parameter names
- Add man page
- What other things should we be doing to make this a proper command line tool?
```

```markdown
# v00.00.01-meta.md

1. Review prompt v00.00.01.md
    - Correct for language accuracy especially technical terms.
    - Ensure that all features in the APPLICATION SPECIFICATION section are properly referenced in the IMPLEMENTION section
      - Annotate the execution steps with the corresponding feature number if it's missing.
      - Ensure that all numbering is consistent.
```

I updated the prompt and meta documents for consistency and clarity per the meta instructions. Now I’ll ensure all features in the specification are referenced in the implementation and fix a typo in the meta file.

# IGNORE BELOW #



- Implement command line completions.

```

- Fixed and clarified `mwt-g/prompts/meta/v00.00.01-meta.md`:
  - Corrected reference to review `v00.00.01.md`.
  - Kept guidance to align features and numbering.

- Improved `mwt-g/prompts/v00.00.01.md`:
  - Cleaned up AI instructions and corrected grammar.
  - Corrected URL example `https:/` → `https://`.
  - Standardized capitalization and file path formatting.
  - Mapped implementation tasks explicitly to features with `[Feature-XX]` tags.
  - Added missing items under Future for `Feature-02`, `Feature-05`, and `Feature-07`.

- Verified no linter issues in both files.

If you want, I can now execute the session directive: implement the items marked `[R]` in the implementation section, create the `bin/mwt-g.ps1`, test scaffolding, and a `README.md`, then run the tests.
