-----------------------------------------------------------
## AI INSTRUCTIONS

1. Only execute items marked with `[R]`.
  - `[ ]` indicates backlog (not yet ready to implement).
  - `[R]` indicates ready to implement in the current session.
  - `[I]` indicates the AI has implemented the code; set this once the work is completed in this session.
  - `[x]` indicates the user has signed off on the implementation.
2. Feature tracking is done using the format `Feature-00[ ]`
  - `[ ]` means that the feature has not been implemented.
  - `[I]` means that the feature is implemented. The AI shall annotate the feature description with the version that it was implemented in.
  - `[x]` is the human sign-off

The prompt to execute the sequence will be
```
Review prompt v00.00.01.md and execute all implementation tasks marked with [R]
```

-----------------------------------------------------------
## APPLICATION SPECIFICATION

This section describes the application; it is not for execution purposes.

### Overview

mwt-g is a command-line tool for creating and launching URL aliases. It can be used within a project or installed globally.

### Features

- Custom URL scheme: `g:/<alias>` → `https://www.google.com/` (example)
- Settings are stored in:
  - A JSON file
  - Searched in the following order (first match wins):
    - Project-local: `./mwt-g/settings.json`
    - User-level: `~/.config/mwt-g/settings.json`

### Usage
- Feature-01[ ]: Adding an alias
  ```
  g g https://www.google.com
  ```


- Feature-02[ ]: Visiting the alias
  ```
  g y
  ```
  - Opens the user's default browser to `https://www.yahoo.com/`

- Feature-03[ ]: Adding an alias smartly
  ```
  g y yahoo
  ```
  - `y` is the alias name
  - If the second parameter is a bare keyword (no scheme), it resolves to `https://www.<param2>.com`

- Feature-04[ ]: Deep links
  ```
  g yn yahoo/news
  ```
  - `yn` is the alias name
  - Expands to `https://www.<param2>.com/news` → `https://www.yahoo.com/news`

- Feature-05[ ]: List aliases
  ```
  g +list
  ```
  - Lists all known aliases

- Feature-06[ ]: Choose navigation end-points
  ```
  g +b yn
  ```
  - `+b` will launch the URL into the registered browser.
  - `+c` will launch using Curl 
  - `+n` will display the URL for the user to click on.

- Feature-07[ ]: Register URL scheme
  ```
  g +register
  ```
  - Registers the custom `g:/` URL scheme with the OS so links like `g:/y` open via this tool

-----------------------------------------------------------
## Technical requirements

### Build Tool instructions
1. Build the tool using PowerShell 7, which should be available everywhere — Windows, macOS, and Linux.
1. Create the tool using best practices for portability — use Context7 to ensure that the most current documentation and best practices are adhered to.
1. Create the script as `mwt-g.ps1` in the `bin/` directory for this project.

### Test Tool instructions
1. Create a test script under `tests/`.
1. Create tests for the `+n` option.
1. Create tests for the `+c` option.


-----------------------------------------------------------
## APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION

### ALWAYS ###
- Maintain a `README.md` for the tool.
- Always write a test and always run the test after each session sequence.

### v00.01.01 
Create the initial version of the application as follows:

1. [R] Implement the ability to add a basic URL (`g g https://www.google.com`). [Feature-01]
1. [R] Implement `+n` (display URL) and make it the default. [Feature-06]

### v00.01.02
1. [ ] Implement `+c` (fetch via curl). [Feature-06]

### v00.01.03
1. [ ] Implement `+b` (open in browser). [Feature-06]

### v00.01.04
1. [ ] Implement smart URL handling. [Feature-03]
1. [ ] Implement deep links. [Feature-04]

### Future
1. [ ] Implement visiting an alias baseline behavior (apply default action). [Feature-02]
1. [ ] Implement alias listing with `+list`. [Feature-05]
1. [ ] Implement OS URL handler registration with `+register`. [Feature-07]

# IGNORE BELOW #



- Implement command line completions.
- Add long parameter names
- Add man page
- What other things should we be doing to make this a proper command line tool?
