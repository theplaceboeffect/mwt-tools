## APPLICATION SPECIFICATION

This section describes the applicaiton, not for execution purposes.

### Overview

mwt-g is a command-line tool for creating and launching URL aliases. It can be used within a project or installed globally.

### Features

- Custom URL scheme: `g:/<alias>` → `https://www.google.com/` (example)
- Settings are stored in:
  - A JSON file
  - Searched in the following order (first match wins):
    - Project-local: `./mwt-g/settings.json`
    - User-level: `~/.config/mwt-g/settings.json`

### Usage
- Feature-01: Adding an alias
  ```
  g g https:/www.google.com
  ```


- Feature-02: Visiting the alias
  ```
  g y
  ```
  - Opens the user's default browser to `https://www.yahoo.com/`

- Feature-03: Adding an alias smartly
  ```
  g y yahoo
  ```
  - `y` is the alias name
  - If the second parameter is a bare keyword (no scheme), it resolves to `https://www.<param2>.com`

- Feature-04: Deep links
  ```
  g yn yahoo/news
  ```
  - `yn` is the alias name
  - Expands to `https://www.<param2>.com/news` → `https://www.yahoo.com/news`

- Feature-05: List aliases
  ```
  g +list
  ```
  - Lists all known aliases

- Feature-06: Choose navigation end-points
  ```
  g +b yn
  ```
  - `+b` will launch the URL into the registered browser.
  - `+c` will launch using Curl 
  - `+n` will display the URL for the user to click on.

- Feature-07: Register URL scheme
  ```
  g +register
  ```
  - Registers the custom `g:/` URL scheme with the OS so links like `g:/y` open via this tool

## Technical requirements

### Build Tool instructions
1. Build the tool using Powershell 7, which should be available everywhere - Windows, MacOS and Linux.
1. Create the tool using the best practices for portability - use Context7 to ensure that the most current documentation and best practices are adhered to.
1. Create the script as mwt-g.ps1 in the bin directory for this project.

### Test Tool instructions
1. Create a test script under tests/.
1. Create tests for the +n option
1. Create tests for the +c option,


-----------------------------------------------------------
## APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION
